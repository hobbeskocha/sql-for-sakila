# SQL for Sakila

This is an **in-progress** collaborative personal portfolio project between Amanda Huang and Ayush Shrestha. The dataset used is the Sakila dataset, originally developed by Mike Hillyer of MySQL AB documentatione team and accessible for PostgreSQL [here](https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila)

## Instructions
The Sakila dataset was selected due to its robust set of relations within the data model, making interesting joins and OLAP possible.
The EDA files will be accessible [here](eda) while the analysis files will be accessible [here](analysis)

## Overview
While video rentals stores have become somewhat extinct in modern times, the principles that underly this analysis hold true for many businesses. We aim to help Sakila DVD rental store understand how its revenues are affected by popularity and late fees, what kinds of movies are more or less likely to be returned late, and where there rentals and revenue come from based on where their customers come from and from which store they interact with. 

To this end, we are performing a series of analysis using PostgreSQL to answer these questions so that Sakila can be better informed on how to allocate its budget towards purchasing new films, ensure proper inventory levels by anticipating late returns, and optimize supply chain to various regions.
