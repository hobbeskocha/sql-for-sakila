# SQL for Sakila

This is an **in-progress** collaborative personal portfolio project between [Amanda Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-huang9/) and [Ayush Shrestha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-yoshi-shrestha/). The dataset used is the Sakila dataset, originally developed by Mike Hillyer of the MySQL AB documentation team and accessible for PostgreSQL [here](https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila)

## Instructions
The Sakila dataset was chosen for its comprehensive relational data model, offering opportunities for complex joins and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) files can be accessed [here](eda), and the analysis files are available [here](analysis).

## Overview
Although video rental stores are rare in today's market, the principles underlying this analysis remain relevant for many businesses. This project aims to provide the Sakila DVD rental store with insights into how revenue is influenced by factors such as movie popularity and late fees. Additionally, it seeks to identify patterns in late returns and understand the geographic distribution of rentals and revenue, based on customer locations and store interactions.

To achieve these objectives, we are conducting a series of analyses using PostgreSQL and Power BI. The findings will enable Sakila to make informed decisions on budget allocation for new film acquisitions, maintain optimal inventory levels by predicting late returns, and enhance supply chain efficiency across different regions.
